Module Eight Journal

Module Seven - Project Three

- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was a item tracker for a grocer. It was designed to read from a file and create a list of word frequencies. The grocer wanted to know how frequently produce items were purchased.

- What did you do particularly well?
The project recommended using maps, a data structure I have never used before. I'm somewhat proud of how I figured out how to use them relatively quickly.

- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I admit I'm not very good at writing good comments. It's hard to put myself in the shoes of someone who doesn't understand my code at a glance when I do. I also didn't ensure the input was error-resistant.

- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Understanding how the file stream worked was confusing. I ended up going to several C++ related tutorials, like Geek4Geek, to get some additional guidance before I understood.

- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Being able to tackle problems from an object-oriented mindset, as well as knowing where I can go to better understand concepts I struggle with.

- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried to write good comments, but I still struggle in this regard. I did do my best to have explanitory variable and method names, however.
